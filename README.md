# Mohammadreza Narimani – Personal Website

Welcome to the personal website of **Mohammadreza Narimani**, a Ph.D. candidate in Biological Systems Engineering at the University of California, Davis, conducting research in digital agriculture and remote sensing.

## 🌐 Site Structure

### 1. Home  
**Hi, I’m Mohammadreza Narimani!**  
Ph.D. Candidate at UC Davis and a researcher at the Digital Agriculture Laboratory. I focus on remote sensing—from handheld hyperspectral measurements to drone, LiDAR, and satellite data—using machine learning and deep learning to monitor agricultural environments. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

### 2. About Me  
- **Education:**  
  - Ph.D. (Biological Systems Engineering), UC Davis (2022–present), GPA 4.0, thesis on AI‑driven remote sensing for tomato crop monitoring.  
  - M.Sc. & B.Sc. in Biosystem Mechanical Engineering from University of Tehran (2015–2021), both with top honors. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **Skills:**  
  - Remote sensing platforms: Sentinel‑2, Landsat‑9, ECOSTRESS, EMIT, drone hyperspectral & LiDAR systems  
  - Programming: Python, R, MATLAB, C++  
  - Techniques: GIS, image processing, deep learning, web app development, IoT & robotics  
  - Libraries and tools: TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit‑learn, geemap, rasterio, QGIS, Google Earth Engine, OpenCV, PlantCV, and more :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- **Leadership & Teaching:**  
  Serving in student governance at UC Davis, mentoring undergraduate and high school students, and holding TA roles in aerial systems, AI, and programming. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

### 3. Research & Blog  
- Featured project: **Sentinel‑2 Vegetation Index Visualizer**, a Google Earth Engine (GEE) app for interactive visualization of indices like NDVI, EVI, SAVI, ARI, NDCI, and more—over user-defined areas and time periods. Supports cloud masking and dynamic legends. Perfect for crop-health monitoring and environmental analysis. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- Blog post spotlight: *"Early Detection of Broomrape in Tomato Farms Using Satellite Imagery and Time‑Series Analysis"*. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

### 4. Teaching Resources  
Two tools for hands‑on learning and IoT experimentation:  
- **TAE30 Temp & RH – Online Mode**: Real‑time monitoring of temperature and humidity via DHT22 + ESP8266 / Parallax board. Updates every second. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- **TAE30 Temp & RH – Offline Mode**: Upload CSV sensor data and visualize temperature/humidity trends if continuous real‑time isn't available. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
