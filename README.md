### 4. Teaching Resources  
Two tools for hands‑on learning and IoT experimentation:  
- **TAE30 Temp & RH – Online Mode**: Real‑time monitoring of temperature and humidity via DHT22 + ESP8266 / Parallax board. Updates every second.  
- **TAE30 Temp & RH – Offline Mode**: Upload CSV sensor data and visualize temperature/humidity trends if continuous real‑time isn't available.
